# !!! Before transfering this to APP router check this issue first !!!

**ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ App Router does not handle dynamic routes when exported to a Single Page APP (SPA)**

## Solution until the problem is fixed

- Every dynamic routes are implemented using the legacy pages router.

## Caveats

- In dev mode (`pnpm run dev`), there's a slight delay when navigating from a `page route` to `app route` (or vice versa). This is probably due to the fact that the whole page is reloaded. BUT **This is not happening when the app is built (pnpm run build).**
